## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** problems and **logic based exercises** (like patterns, maths, recursion, etc.) that I solve as part of my coding practice journey.

I aim to write **clean**, **readable**, and **efficient** Java code while improving my **problem solving** and **logical thinking** skills.
